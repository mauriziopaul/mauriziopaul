- 👋 Hi, I’m @mauriziopaul (Paul L. Maurizio), based at the University of Chicago.
- 👀 I’m interested in quantitative genetics and genomics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning approaches for better modeling single-cell data, cell type-specific and shared genomic effects, and colocalization of eQTL and GWAS signals.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building better tools, packages, and analysis pipelines for emerging (multi)omic data sets.
- 📫 How to reach me: message me at [paul@genomic.social](https://genomic.social/@paul).
